            <p>
              The Fishing Challenge is, as the name implies, supposed to be a challenge for new and experienced fishers to try their hand at catching a specific fish.  This might be hard if you don't know where to look.  Luckily we have all the resources that you would need right here on The Fish Net to help you with the Fishing Challenge.  If you do not like the current fish that you are being challenged to catch, don't worry.  Just refresh the page and a new fish will come up.  Fish will be decided depending on which day of the week it is.  So good luck catching the Fishing Challenge fish!
