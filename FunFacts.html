              <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
              <p>
                There are a lot of things that one can do to get better at fishing.  Here on The Fish Net, we would like to make sure that everyone has the ability to be the best fisher that they can be.  Here are some tips and tricks to improve your fishing game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fish Early Or Late
                  <ul>
                    <li>Fish often times are more active in darker areas.  Fish like darker cooler places.  This is why it is important to fish early or late in the day because their will be more fish that are swimming around.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fish Where There Is Shade
                  <ul>
                    <li>Much like the above answer.  Fish like cold and dark places.  So if you are unable to fish earlier or later in the day,  Finding a dark spot with shade would be best.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fishing Lure Colors
                  <ul>
                    <li>You will never know what fish will prefer what color on that specific day.  A good starting point would be to use a lure that's color matches the color of the water.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fishing Lure Shape And Sizes
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make sure that you are using the appropriate shapes and sizes for the fish that you are trying to catch.  If the lure is too big no fish will bite.  If the lure is too small it can be deadly to the fish.  So make sure you are using an appropriate size for that fish.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do Your Research
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make sure to do some research before you try and go fishing.  Luckily for you, The Fish Net is the perfect place to do that research.</li>

                    <h3>Open Water vs. Ice Fishing</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are major differences when it comes to open water fishing and ice fishing. There also comes a few similarities. Understanding these differences and similarities will help you find the fish you are looking for and hook them. Here we will go through a couple topics to better your understanding of open water and ice fishing.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Gear</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having the correct gear is the first step to landing that big one. Most of the differences between ice fishing and open water fishing comes down to the gear. Open water fishing allows for easier mobility to cover more water. Some gear that will be needed for open water fishing will include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boat (Optional)</li>
                        <li>Fishing rod</li>
                        <li>Net</li>
                        <li>Bait</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Ice fishing is less mobile; therefore, the gear will vary. Some of the necessary gear includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ice shack (Optional)</li>
                        <li>Fishing rod</li>
                        <li>Ice auger</li>
                        <li>Bait</li>
                        <li>Warmer clothes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Fish Behaviors</h4>
                    <p>
                        As the water temperatures change, so do the fish behaviors. The fish can feel the weather change just as much as we do. During the hotter times of the year, fish tend to be more active and even spawn. As the water warms up, smaller bait fish become more active, and this leads to the bigger fish following along to feed. However, when it gets too hot out, they may move into shaded areas or deeper water. As winter ice comes, some of the fish will become less mobile to save energy. This also means they will feed very little so getting them to bite may be a problem. Other fish like panfish or lake trout tend to stay just as lively in the winter and not change their feeding habits. Due to fish being less active in the winter you may need to move to find the fish, but when you find them you will be golden.
